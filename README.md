- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling framework for a sleek, responsive design
- **Firebase**: Backend service for authentication and data storage
- **Vercel**: Platform for deploying and hosting the application

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v12.x or later)
- npm or yarn

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
